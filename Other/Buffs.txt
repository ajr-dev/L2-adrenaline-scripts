For Interlude I want to know which buffs to use for PVE for mage and fighter if I have a 26 buff limit. I've been looking to which buffs cancel each other and made a list here. Also I want to know which buffs to use first in case somebody buffs me with useless buffs and I lose them. Specifically I'm using sps, necro, bounty hunter.
I'd also like to see a topic about dyes for each class for farming, is there any? I only found one for dyes for each class but didn't specify if they were for pvp or pve.
